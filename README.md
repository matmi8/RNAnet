# RNAnet 
RNAnet allows to study the miRNA-mediated crosstalk between couples of RNA molecules. 
The programme needs to know the miRNA-RNA network structure and set of parameters (reaction rates and binding affinities).
It permit to evaluate the steady state levels of free miRNA and RNA molecules together with the susceptibility matrix.
